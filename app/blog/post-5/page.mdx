# How to setup reCAPTCHA v2 in a Rails and React app

## Introduction

What is reCAPTCHA and why is it important?

[reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) is a tool designed by Google to help protect websites from spam messages or bots. You've probably seen it before - v2 is the 'I'm not a robot' checkbox or spotting the bridge in a grid of images.

Scripts, bots and most kinds of automated software can't solve these challenges in a convincingly 'human' way. For example, a bot would take a slow and direct route to a v2 checkbox, while a human may move their mouse around the page, click on other elements, and take a few seconds to check the box.

As developers, we want to reduce the amount of 'noise' messages we receive via forms on our websites. reCAPTCHA is a great tool for doing this.

## Getting started

You should go to the [reCAPTCHA admin console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create) and create a new site. You'll need to enter a label (for your own reference) and the domain of your website. You can also choose which reCAPTCHA version you want to use - we'll be using v2.

> NOTE: for development purposes, you can add `Localhost` to the list of domains. This will allow you to test reCAPTCHA on your local machine.

Once you've created your site, you'll be given a site key and a secret key. Keep a note of these - we'll need them later.

# Adding reCAPTCHA to your Frontend app

In this short guide, I will be using NextJS and React with TypeScript.

We'll be using the [react-google-recaptcha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-recaptcha) package to add reCAPTCHA to our React app.

If you're using a different Frontend, you'll need to find a package that works for you. But, the process remains similar:

- Add the respective package to your project
- Import the package into your app/component
- Add the reCAPTCHA component to your form
- Add the reCAPTCHA site key to your app - via an `.env` file or other secret management tool

In the frontend, we will be using the reCAPTCHA element (tickbox in this case) which creates a token that we can send to the backend for verification. Although you can verify the token on the frontend, it's best practice to do this on the backend.

## Adding the reCAPTCHA component

- Save the site key to an environment variable i.e. in a `.env` file
  - In your React app, you can save this variable as `REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`.
  - In a NextJS app, you will need to prefix the variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` i.e. `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`. Why? Read more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#bundling-environment-variables-for-the-browser).
- You can create a separate component for the reCAPTCHA element, or add it to your form component. In this case, we will add to the form component.
- Import `ReCAPTCHA` from the `react-google-recaptcha`
  - package: `import ReCAPTCHA from 'react-google-recaptcha'`
- Add the reCAPTCHA element:

```jsx
  <ReCAPTCHA
    ref={}
    sitekey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY}
    onChange={}
  />
```

- The `ref` prop is used to reset the reCAPTCHA element. We'll use this later.
- The `sitekey` prop is the site key we saved earlier.
- The `onChange` prop is a function that will be called when the user completes the reCAPTCHA challenge. We'll use this to save the token to state.
- We will use `useState` to save the token to state:

```tsx
const [recaptchaToken, setRecaptchaToken] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

- We will also use `useRef` to create a reference to the reCAPTCHA element:

```tsx
const recaptchaRef = useRef<ReCAPTCHA>(null);
```

- Add a function to handle the captcha change - let's call it `handleCaptchaChange`:

```tsx
const handleCaptchaChange = (value: string | null) => {
  if (value === null) {
    return;
  }
  setRecaptchaToken(value);
};
```

- Now, edit the reCAPTCHA element to use the `recaptchaRef` and `handleCaptchaChange`:

```tsx
<ReCAPTCHA
  ref={recaptchaRef}
  sitekey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY}
  onChange={handleCaptchaChange}
/>
```

Hopefully, at this point, the reCAPTCHA should render on your form. If not, try restarting your console.

One thing I had to do to get the initial reCAPTCH to work was to wrap the reCAPTCHA in a conditional statement. In TypeScript React apps, `process.env` is not treated as defined, even if it is explicitly defined in your `.env` file.

```tsx
{
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY && (
    <ReCAPTCHA
      ref={recaptchaRef}
      sitekey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY}
      onChange={handleCaptchaChange}
    />
  );
}
```

## Resetting the reCAPTCHA element

We need to reset the reCAPTCHA element when the form is submitted. This is so that the user can't submit the form multiple times with the same token.

This is where `useRef` comes in. In your form's `onSubmit` function, you can reset the reCAPTCHA element by calling `recaptchaRef.current?.reset()`.

e.g.

```tsx
// note: I'm using react-hook-form here
const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<FormValues> = async (data) => {
  // ... other form submission logic

  // check if the user has completed the reCAPTCHA challenge
  if (recaptchaToken ===  || !recaptchaToken) {
    // ... here you can also add a message to the user to complete the reCAPTCHA challenge, or some kind of loading or error handling

    // if not, return early
    return;
  }

  // ... submit request to backend - using a try/catch block
  try {
    // ... submit request to backend
    // NOTE: remember to send the recaptchaToken to the backend for verification
  } catch (error) {
    // ... handle error
  } finally {
    // ... reset the reCAPTCHA element
    recaptchaRef.current?.reset();
  }
}
```

In summary, use a `try/catch/finally` block (good practice) to make your request and in the `finally` block, reset the reCAPTCHA reference.

Also, note that you should be sending the reCAPTCHA token to the backend for verification. We'll cover this in the next section.

# Checkpoint

You should now have a working reCAPTCHA element on your form. When the user completes the challenge, the token should be saved to state. When the form is submitted, the reCAPTCHA element should be reset - regardless of whether the form is submitted successfully or not.

# Adding reCAPTCHA to your Backend app

In my case, I did this in a Rails app. But, the process should be similar for other backend frameworks.

- Store the server key we generated earlier in an environment variable. You can do this in your `.env` file.

  > In my case, I didn't use the [`recaptcha`](https://github.com/ambethia/recaptcha) gem. This is a route you can take. For educational purposes, I chose to verify the token manually.

- In your controller, you can create a method to verify the token:

```ruby
  def validate_recaptcha
    recaptcha_secret_key = ENV['SERVER_RECAPTCHA_KEY']
    recaptcha_response = params['captcha']

    uri = URI('https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify')
    http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
    http.use_ssl = true

    request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.path)
    request.set_form_data(
      'secret' => recaptcha_secret_key,
      'response' => recaptcha_response
    )

    response = http.request(request)

    if response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
      data = JSON.parse(response.body)
      return data['success']
    else
      return false
    end
  end
```

- In the above code, this is what happens:
  - We create a URI object for the reCAPTCHA verification endpoint
  - We create a new HTTP object and set `use_ssl` to true
  - We create a new POST request to the reCAPTCHA verification endpoint
  - We set the form data to include the secret key and the token
  - We send the request and parse the response
  - If the response is successful, we return the `success` value from the response body
- You can then use this method in your controller action for the form submission, e.g.:

```ruby
def some_form_method
  if validate_recaptcha
    # ... do something with the form data
  else
    # ... reject the form submission as the reCAPTCHA token is invalid
  end
end
```

# Conclusion

You should now have a working reCAPTCHA on a React form with verification in your backend. Your form is now protected from spam messages and bots. Voil√°!
