# How to create a small microservice app with Ruby on Rails (RoR) and TypeScript React (ReactTS) (Part 1)

How to use this Tutorial:

- Read it! There's a lot in here to help with learning and understanding basic microservice architecture e.g. CORS policies
- Bullet pointed sections are Actions - these are what you need to do
- Give me any feedback if there are any mistakes in the tutorial

Advanced Tutorial that requires some basic knowledge in:

- Ruby on Rails setup (follow the basic tutorial)
- RESTful APIs and [HTTP Request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript

Technical and installation requirements:

- Ruby (and rbenv), v3.1.2
- Ruby on Rails, v>7.0.6
- NodeJS, v>16.13.1

## Creating the Rails API

We will use have this folder structure:

```
grad_project
├── api # <-- Rails API app
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── controllers
│   │   │   └── api
│   │   │       └── v1
│   │   │           └── posts_controller.rb
│   │   └── models
│           └── post.rb
├── client # <-- ReactTS app
│   └── src
...
```

### 0. Setup Ruby on Rails (RoR)

- Install Ruby on Rails (RoR) - [official docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
- Instructions vary depending on OS

### 1. rails new [API_APP_NAME] --api

With Ruby on Rails (RoR), the standard `rails new` generator usually creates a full MVC RoR app, with RoR Views.

In order to use a different Frontend framework, it is best practice to make the RoR app API-only - that is, only Model and Controllers (and other middleware) but no Views.

You can generate this with:

```
rails new [API_APP_NAME] --api -T
```

**Note**: I usually specify the `-T` flag to prevent autogeneration of `Minitest` unit test, as I prefer to use `RSpec` for tests (more about [RSpec](https://rspec.info/))

The `--api` flag specifies this is an API-only app, preventing autogeneration of Views

- Do the usual `bundle install` and other configurations you may do now

### 2. Setup and enabling CORS

Cross Origin Resource Sharing ([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)) is a form of security that checks the origin (URL) of HTTP requests.

The app that we will build will have two origin URLs - in our local development environment, this will most likely be `localhost:3000` for the RoR app and `localhost:3001` for the ReactTS app.

As such, you need to update the CORS policy in the RoR app to allow requests from the ReactTS app we will build

- Add or uncomment `gem 'rack-cors'` in the `gemfile`
- Run `bundle install`
- Find this file `config/initializers/cors.rb` and update the `origins` line to `origins '*'` - this will accept requests from any origin. The file should look like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
  allow do
    origins '*'
resource '*',
      headers: :any,
      methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head]
  end
end
```

- FOR LATER: we will update the origins later to accept requests from the ReactTS app at whatever port you specify, e.g. `localhost:3001`, as well as for a future deployed app URL (as a comma-delimited list of string URLS)

### 3a. Setup test packages (OPTIONAL)

For automated testing, we will use RSpec ([official docs](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)). It is important to set this up now, as RSpec will autogenerate test files when you generate Models and Controllers later on.

- Add `gem 'rspec-rails'` to the gemfile
  - best practice is to add it to the `group :development, :test do ... end` block, so the test packages aren't used in the deployed app
- Also add `gem 'factory_bot_rails'`
  - this is used to programmatically generate instances for automated testing
- Add `gem 'simplecov'`
  - this is used to generate test coverage reports
  - Read the official docs on how to set this up ([docs](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov))
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rails generate rspec:install` to generate boilerplate configurations

That's all for now.

### 3. Generate Post Model, Controller and Routes

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will create one Post model and one Post controller.

**Note**: from here, I will be using some shortened commands in RoR, like `rails g` instead of `rails generate`

- Run `rails g model post title:string content:text`
  - remember this must be singular - this generates a Model (and test file, if you setup RSpec) called Post with title and content fields
- (OPTIONAL) add validations to the Post model, if needed
- Run `rails g controller posts index show create update delete`
  - this will generate a `posts_controller` file with empty methods called index, show, create, update and delete.
- Run `rails db:create db:migrate`
  - you _may_ run into errors here where you need to add a username and password to the `config/database.yml` file.
  - The username provided needs to exist in your PostgresSQL local setup and have permissions to create tables

We will use RESTful API naming convention best practice for versioning and move the `posts_controller.rb` file to a new folder. You can read more on this [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/389169/best-practices-for-api-versioning).

- In the `controllers` folder, create a new folder `api`
- In the `api` folder, create a new folder called `v1`
- Move the `posts_controller.rb` to the `v1` folder
- In the `posts_controller.rb` file, change `class PostsController < ApplicationController` to `class Api::V1::PostsController < ApplicationController`

To help with learning, we will add some comments to the `posts_controller.rb` file to show where these methods should route to:

```
class Api::v1::PostsController < ApplicationController
  # GET /posts
  def index
  end

  # GET /posts/:id
  def show
  end

  # POST /posts
  def create
  end

  # PATCH/PUT /posts/:id
  def update
  end

  # DELETE /posts/:id
  def destroy
  end
end
```

Now it's time to update the `routes.rb` file:

- In the `routes.rb` file, add:

```
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do

  end
end
```

- In the :v1 block, add `resources :posts, only: [:index, :show, :create, :update, :delete]`
  - The `resources` keyword handles the route mapping, so you don't need to specify each HTTP request method

### 4. Seed the database

At the moment, we don't have any data in the db to test our `post_controller.rb` endpoints.

We will create/update the `db/seeds.rb` file to create a few posts for us to test

- At the top of the `db/seeds.rb` file add `require 'faker`
- Let's create 10 posts using Ruby's `times` iterator, add this block:

```
10.times do

end
```

- In that block, add a `post` variable that we will create a Post instance in:

```
post = Post.create(
  title: Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_count: 3),
  content: Faker::Lorem.paragraph(sentence_count: 2)
)
```

- (OPTIONAL) add some `print` statements to the file to get feedback when instances are created e.g. add `print 'Created \#{post}'` in the Post.create block

The seed file should look something like this:

```
require 'faker'

10.times do
  post = Post.create(
    title: Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_count: 3),
    content: Faker::Lorem.paragraph(sentence_count: 2)
  )
  print 'Created \#{post}'
end
```

- Run `rails db:seed` to seed the database

### 5. Add callbacks and private methods to the Post controller

There's one more thing that can improve the `posts_controller.rb` file - callbacks and private methods.

- Add a `before_action` callback to the `posts_controller.rb` file:
  - This will run the `set_post` method before the `show`, `update` and `destroy` methods

```
before_action :set_post, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]
```

- Add a private method `set_post` to the `posts_controller.rb` file:
  - This will find the Post instance by the `:id` param in the URL

```
private

def set_post
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])
end
```

**NOTE**: place all your private methods at the bottom of the controller file, below the `private` keyword

We also need to add a `post_params` method to the `posts_controller.rb` file.

Why? This is a security measure to prevent malicious users from sending requests with extra parameters that we don't want to be saved in the database.

- Add a private method `post_params` to the `posts_controller.rb` file:
  - This will only allow the `title` and `content` parameters to be saved in the database

```
def post_params
  params.require(:post).permit(:title, :content)
end
```

Whenever you add new fields to the database, you will need to update this method to allow those fields to be saved.

### 6. Write the CRUD methods in the Post controller

Now we can write the CRUD methods in the `posts_controller.rb` file.

- In the `index` method, add:

```
@posts = Post.all
render json: @posts
```

- In the `show` method, add:

```
render json: @post
```

- In the `create` method, add:

```
@post = Post.new(post_params)

if @post.save
  render json: @post, status: :created
else
  render json: @post.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
end
```

- In the `update` method, add:

```
if @post.update(post_params)
  render json: @post
else
  render json: @post.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
end
```

- In the `destroy` method, add:

```
@post.destroy
```

**NOTE**: notice that we don't need to render anything in the `destroy` method, as the Post instance is already deleted

- (OPTIONAL) write tests for the CRUD methods in the `posts_controller_spec.rb` file

### 7. Test the API endpoints (Manually)

Using a third party app called [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), we can test the API endpoints we just created.

- Open Postman and create a new request
- Set the request method to `GET` and the URL to `localhost:3000/api/v1/posts`
- Click `Send` and you should see a list of all the posts in the database
- Do the same for the other request methods, `POST`, `PATCH/PUT` and `DELETE` with the appropriate URLs and HTTP request methods

This is an important step to test the API endpoints before we move on to the ReactTS app.

### 7a. Adding custom endpoints

We can also add custom endpoints to the `posts_controller.rb` file.

For example, we can add a `search` endpoint that will search for posts with a specific title.

- In the `posts_controller.rb` file, add:

```
def search
  @posts = Post.where('title LIKE ?', '%\#{params[:title]}%')
  render json: @posts
end
```

- In the `routes.rb` file, add to the `:v1` block:

```
get '/search', to: 'posts#search'
```

- (OPTIONAL) write tests for the `search` method in the `posts_controller_spec.rb` file

**NOTE**: in the case of a Search endpoint, you may want to use a gem called [pg_search](https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search) to improve the search functionality

# Checkpoint 1 - Rails API

At this point, you should have:

- A Rails API app with a Post model, controller and routes
- CRUD methods for the Post model
- Seed data in the database
- (Optional) tests for the CRUD methods
- (Optional) a custom Search endpoint

Additionally, after manually testing the endpoints, you should be able to see the JSON response in Postman.
