### 10. Add Delete functionality to the `PostItem` component

Delete can be handled in the `PostItem` component with a button.

- In the `PostItem` file, add:

```
import axios from 'axios';

export const PostItem = ({ post }: { post: Post }) => {
  // rest stays the same

  const handleDelete = async () => {
    try {
      await axios.delete(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/posts/${post.id}`);
    }
    catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{post.title}</h3>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
      <Button
        variant='primary'
        onClick={() => setShow(true)}
        className='mb-3'
      >Edit Post</Button>
      <Button
        variant='danger'
        onClick={handleDelete}
        className='mb-3'
      >Delete Post</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you run the app, you should be able to delete posts.

It's best practice to add a confirmation modal before deleting a post, so that the user can confirm that they want to delete the post.

- In the `PostItem` file, add:

```
import { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';

export const PostItem = ({ post }: { post: Post }) => {
  // rest stays the same
  const [showDeleteModal, setShowDeleteModal] = useState(false);

  const DeleteModal = () => {
    return (
      <Modal show={showDeleteModal} onHide={() => setShowDeleteModal(false)}>
        <Modal.Header closeButton>
          <Modal.Title>Delete Post</Modal.Title>
        </Modal.Header>
        <Modal.Body>
          <p>Are you sure you want to delete this post?</p>
          <Button
            variant='danger'
            onClick={handleDelete}
            className='mb-3'
          >Delete Post</Button>
        </Modal.Body>
      </Modal>
    )
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{post.title}</h3>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
      <Button
        variant='primary'
        onClick={() => setShow(true)}
        className='mb-3'
      >Edit Post</Button>
      <Button
        variant='danger'
        onClick={() => setShowDeleteModal(true)}
        className='mb-3'
      >Delete Post</Button>
      <DeleteModal />
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you run the app, you should see a button that opens a modal with the `PostForm` component. The `PostForm` component should be pre-filled with the post data if you're editing a post.

#### 11. Check the RoR API app and add CORS updates

You may have some issues creating, editing, and deleting posts at this point.

This may be due to CORS issues. You can check the Rails API app logs to see if there are any CORS errors.

We can make some changes to the `posts_controller.rb` file to allow requests from the ReactTS app.

- In the `posts_controller.rb` file, add:

```
before_action :set_access_control_headers

# add a new private method

def set_access_control_headers
  headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
  headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS'
  headers['Access-Control-Request-Method'] = '*'
  headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'
end
```

You will need to update this later if you deploy the app i.e. to add the production URL.

# Checkpoint 4 - ReactTS app

You should now have a basic CRUD app with a ReactTS frontend and a Rails API backend.

You can continue to add more features to the app, such as:

- Add a Search bar
- Add pagination
- Add authentication using Devise and JWT
- Add a User model
- Add a Comment model
- Add a Like model
- Optimize the app for performance
- Add tests for the ReactTS app
- Add tests for the Rails API app
- Better styling
- More types for the ReactTS app e.g. `PostListProps`, `PostItemProps`, `PostFormProps`
- Other pages e.g. About page, Contact page
- Deploy the app to Heroku and Vercel

# A Note about Authentication

If you want to add authentication to the app, you can use Devise and JWT.

Devise is a popular authentication gem for Rails. JWT is a popular authentication method for APIs.

- In the `Gemfile`, add:

```
gem 'devise'
gem 'devise-jwt'
```

- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rails generate devise:install`
- Run `rails generate devise User`
- Run `rails generate devise:controllers users`
- Run `rails generate devise:jwt_secret`

This may not work in generating the JWT secret. You can also use `rails secret` to generate a secret key and add it to an `.env` file in the RoR root app. Then you would add `config.jwt_secret = ENV['JWT_SECRET']` to the `devise.rb` file.

- Run `rails db:migrate`
- In the `routes.rb` file, add:

```
devise_for :users,
  path: '',
  path_names: {
    sign_in: 'login',
    sign_out: 'logout',
    registration: 'signup'
  },
  controllers: {
    sessions: 'users/sessions',
    registrations: 'users/registrations'
  }
  # rest of the routes stay the same
```

- In the `sessions_controller.rb` file, add:

```
respond_to :json

def create
  super do |user|
    if request.format.json?
      render json: {
        user: user,
        token: JWT.encode({
          user_id: user.id,
          username: user.username,
        }, ENV['DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY'], 'HS256')
      } and return
    end
  end
end

def destroy
  signed_out = (Devise.sign_out_all_scopes ? sign_out : sign_out(resource_name))

  if request.format.json?
    render json: { message: 'Signed out successfully' }, status: :ok
  else
    redirect_to after_sign_out_path_for(resource_name)
  end
end
```

You will also need to add login forms to the ReactTS app and update the `PostList` component to fetch the posts based on the user.

Additionally, you may need to add a method to check the JWT received by the RoR API app is valid before allowing the user to access the API endpoints.

This is one of the trickier parts of the app, so you may want to skip this for now and come back to it later.
